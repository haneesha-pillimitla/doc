unit testion and junit

->unittesting
   gives early look in quality
   breaking doen a system into its components

junit=automation and repeatability to allow more testiong more oftens


junit
 adding the junit ->properties->java build path->libreries->add junit lib
 adding java test classes -> select wizard ->java->junit-> 
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 JUnit 4-> has everything bundled into single jar file.requires java 5 or higher

Junit 5-> is composed of 3 sub-projects i.e. JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter and JUnit Vintage. requires java8 and higher

JUnit Platform
---------------
It defines the TestEngine API for developing new testing frameworks that runs on the platform.

JUnit Jupiter
---------------
It has all new junit annotations and TestEngine implementation to run tests written with these annotations.

JUnit Vintage
---------------
To support running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 written tests on the JUnit 5 platform.

Junit 4-> org.junit.Assume contains methods for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. It has following five methods:
----------------------
assumeFalse()
assumeNoException()
assumeNotNull()
assumeThat()
assumeTrue()

Junit 5->org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions contains methods for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. It has following three methods:
--------------------------
assumeFalse()
assumingThat()
assumeTrue()
