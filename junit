unit testion and junit

->unittesting
   gives early look in quality
   breaking doen a system into its components

junit=automation and repeatability to allow more testiong more oftens


junit
 adding the junit ->properties->java build path->libreries->add junit lib
 adding java test classes -> select wizard ->java->junit-> 
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 JUnit 4-> has everything bundled into single jar file.requires java 5 or higher

Junit 5-> is composed of 3 sub-projects i.e. JUnit Platform, JUnit Jupiter and JUnit Vintage. requires java8 and higher

JUnit Platform
---------------
It defines the TestEngine API for developing new testing frameworks that runs on the platform.

JUnit Jupiter
---------------
It has all new junit annotations and TestEngine implementation to run tests written with these annotations.

JUnit Vintage
---------------
To support running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 written tests on the JUnit 5 platform.

 assert -fource full start
 
Junit 4-> org.junit.Assume contains methods for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. It has following five methods:
----------------------
assumeFalse()
assumeNoException()
assumeNotNull()
assumeThat()
assumeTrue()

Junit 5->org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions contains methods for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. It has following three methods:
--------------------------
assumeFalse()
assumingThat()
assumeTrue()


 fall("not yet implemented");--error if the code is not difined
 
 definng test in junit
 
 running from java code
 general Assertions
 Number Equality
 Object Equality
 array Equality
 Basic assert That Options
 combinations and assert that
 custom assertThat Matchers
 Assume versus Assert
 Setting up test Cases
 Test Fixtures
 

mocking
-----------
mockito + junit
->mocking refers to the development of the object which are a mock or clone of real objects.
->in the technique mock objects are used instead of real objects for testing.
(for every input it gives some output)

mockito
---------
->Mockito is an open source framework that allows you to easily create test doubles (mocks). Test Double is a generic term for any case where you replace a production object for testing purposes.
->mockito is a java based framework used for unit testing of java applications.
->this mocking framework helps in development of testable applications.
(validating the behaviour of the application or framework)


setting the mockito
----------------------------
To add mockito into the project,add jar file in pom.xml.

pom.xml
-------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.23.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>



mackito annotations
-------------------
->@Mock is used for mock creation. It makes the test class more readable.
->@Spy is used to create a spy instance. We can use it instead spy(Object) method.
->@InjectMocks is used to instantiate the tested object automatically and inject all the @Mock or @Spy annotated field dependencies into it (if applicable).
->@Captor is used to create an argument captor.
