oops
------------------------------------------------------

oops -- methodolagy to design program using object and classes


object real world entity
class- blue print of an object
            animal class ----object is dog,cat,sheep
         hand properties like breed , size, age, color
              behavior like bark,sleep


---- oops it bottom to up
             divide into objects
               access modifier
                 more secure
                  supports overloading


->class
-----------------
blue print of an object
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual 
object. Class doesn't consume any space
A class in Java can contain:
• Fields
• Methods
• Constructors
• Blocks
• Nested class and interfac
ex:-
class Cricketer
{
      public static void main(String args[])
      {
	System.out.prinlnt("Hit Sixer");
      }
}

->object
-----------------
it is an entity
it shares two characteristics (state and behavior)
An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address 
and takes up some space in memory.
ex:-
Cricketer c1=new Cricketer();


->Abstraction
------------------
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For 
example, phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
//(what it  is) 

->data encapsulation           
---------------------------
hiding the implementation details of the class from the user
it binds code and data together
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as 
encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
 A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated 
class because all the data members are private here.
//(functionalities)

->inheritance                
--------------------------
(isA) relationship
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is 
known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime 
polymorphism.
inheriting the properties of parent class


->polymorphism
-------------------------------
If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. 
In Java, we use method overloading to achieve polymorphism.




public interface- software entities interact with each other in a system or network,this help in data security

Construc- it is a "special function" that has the "same name" as of the enclosing class
it does NOT have return type
but it can take parameters/arguments
it is AUTOMATICALLY invoked DURING OBJECT CREATION TIME

1.private-inside class
2.public- inside class, inside & outside package , outside package subclass.
3.default- inside class ,only inside package.
4.protected- inside class , inside package , outside package subclass.


Abstract class
------------------------
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.	
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.         	
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.	
6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.	
7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".	
8) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.	
9)Example:-
public abstract class Shape{
public abstract void draw();
}	

Interface                       //working
-----------------------------
1)Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
2)Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3)Interface has only static and final variables.
4)Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
5)The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
6)An interface can extend another Java interface only.
7)An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements".
8)Members of a Java interface are public by default.
Example:-
public interface Drawable{
void draw();
}

Exceptions
1.checked(by compiler)
   IOException,SQLException
2.unchecked(during run)
   NullpointerException,ArithmeticException
   
solution -try catch
 
->Multithreading 
--------------------------------------------
Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

 Steps to multithreaded program
	Method A : a. extend from Thread class
	Method B : a. implement from Runnable interface
Method A : 
a. extend from Thread class
b. override its run() method
        write the logic to participate in threading
c. and call its start() method
        which will invoke your run() method


Method B :
a. implement from Runnable interface
b. implement the public void run()
        write the logic to participate in threading
c. and now create object of 
        java.lang.Thread class
	-pass our Runnable's child object to the constructor of Thread class
d. call Thread's start() which will invoke
		your Runnables run()

S.N.	Modifier and Type	 Method	        Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1)	void	             start()            used to start the execution of the thread.
2)	void	             run()	        used to do an action for a thread.
3)	static void	             sleep()	        sleeps a thread for the specified amount of time.
4)	static Thread	currentThread()     It returns a reference to the currently executing thread object.
5)	void	            join()	        waits for a thread to die.
6)	int	            getPriority()       returns the priority of the thread.
7)	void	            setPriority()       changes the priority of the thread.
8)	String	            getName()	        returns the name of the thread.
9)	void	            setName()	        changes the name of the thread.
