------------------------------------------------------

oops -- methodolagy to design program using object and classes


object real world entity
class- blue print of an object
            animal class ----object is dog,cat,sheep
         hand properties like breed , size, age, color
              behavior like bark,sleep


---- oops it bottom to up
             divide into objects
               access modifier
                 more secure
                  supports overloading


=>onjects--it is an entity
it shares two characteristics (state and behavior)
                                 
=>data encapsulation-- hiding the implementation details of the class from the user
it binds code and data together

=>public interface- software entities interact with each other in a system or network,this help in data security

=>inheritance 
(isA) relationship

inheriting the properties of parent class
(extends)
