used to create and deploy 


before microservices -monolithic architecture (big container contain all services )/large and complex/
*microservices ,aka nicroservices architecture,is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modelled around a business domain

->monolithic architecture can be defined as a framwork , wherein all the features of the system are put on a single codebase and are under a single databse
challenges of monolithic architecture-changes cannot be accommodated
                                     -continuous development is not possible
                                     -cannot accomodate various technology stacks
                                     -framework is unrellable 
developers thinks to recreate monolithic application to multiple deployable components called micro services

-->introduction to microservices
microservices are an architecture where in all the components of the system are put into individual components,whichcan be built,deployed, and scaled individually.

ex:-
person requested
|
request sent to identity provider
|
Api Gateway (act as entry point for all the request from users)
|                       request passes to specific micro service
static content(uses as system service discovery and also act as route of communication)
|
CDN


micro services has agile teams ex:- video upload team,search team etc


->containers-each microservice is assigned to a container. Containers are a good way to manage microservice based application to develop and deploy them individually

->communication b/w microservices-> microservices communicate between each other through a stateless server i.e. HTTP REST/Message Bus.



challenges-perceptibility
          -configuration management
          -debugging
          -consistency
          -automating the components

solutions for this challenges is springboot
