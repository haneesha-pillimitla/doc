java 8
-----------------------------------------------------
supports
=>functional programing-> lambda expression

void abstractFun(int x);//declaration in FuncInterface interface
FuncInterface fobj = (int x)->System.out.println(2*x);//obj creatin to interface and lambda expersion 
fobj.abstractFun(5);//calling

,functional interfaces in Java
            


=>javascript engine
=>new APIs (date time manipulation , new streaming APi)



features
=>lambda expression -adds functional processing capability to java
=>Method references - referencing functions by their names insead 

   There are four kinds of method references:
     Static methods.
     Instance methods of particular objects.
     Instance methods of an arbitrary object of a particular type.
     Constructor

=>Default method - interface to have default method implementation
=>New tools-new compilwe tools and utilites are added like 'jdeps' to figure out dependencies.
=>stream API -new stream API to facilitate pipeline processing( the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result. The features of Java stream are – A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.)
=>Date Time API-improved date time API
